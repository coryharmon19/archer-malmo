	<h1>Archer Malmo Trip</h1>
	<body>
		<p>On Friday, December 8th, 2017, we took a trip to Archer-Malmo in downtown Memphis.  Archer-Malmo is a an advertisement firm that creates website for clients for a profit.  For our trip, we took a school bus right after second period ended, and headed downtown.  While we were en route to Archer-Malmo, we got a flat tire on the bus, and had to stop for a brief time.  Once we arrived at the building that Archer-Malmo is located in, we waited in the lobby for Katie Sinclair's friend that works at said company, Ben.</p>
		<p>  Ben came down in an elevator and sent us up few by few to the fourth floor.  Once we reached the fourth floor we recieved greetings from several Archer-Malmo epmployees.  We then sat on the floor and listened to the employees talk about their jobs, how they got into coding, and their recommendations for the students who wish to pursue coding as a career (Frankly, I really didn't care about the coding parts, I liked to hear the business aspect).</p>
		 <p> After we finsihed listening to the employees speak, we were then taken on a tour throughout the building, going up and down to the floors that Archer-Malmo owns for the tour.  We saw all the floors the business is conducted on, and also a photography studio that was in the basement of the building.  We then went back to the lobby of the building and said our goodbyes to the staff that gave us our tours.</p>
		<p>   Once we all got back on the bus, we went to Cookout to eat.  I tell you what, I ate a lot of food there.  Like a lot.  We stayed at Cookout for maybe an hour, and then headed back on the bus to go home.  On our way back, Katie Sinclair began overstressing over the idea that she may have left someone back at Cookout.  She was also very visibly uncomfortable with the idea of being on the bus, for this trip was the first time she had ever ridden one.  Overall it was a good trip.  I can't complain about it.</p>
